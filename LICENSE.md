This software source is provided for two main purposes

    1) for my own personal resume building purposes
    
    2) for reference among android developers to serve as an example of the development process
    
    3) for bug fix suggestions and feature extensions from the open source community
    
My team has graciously allowed me to publish the front end native code online for the betterment of the open source community under these conditions!
